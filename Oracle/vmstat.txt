#info about columns vmstat

If b (processes sleeping) is consistently greater than 0, you may not have enough CPU
processing power.

If so (memory swapped out to disk) and si (memory swapped in from disk) are
consistently greater than 0, you may have a memory bottleneck. On some systems,
these columns may be labeled pi and po.

If the wa (time waiting for I/O) column is high, it is usually an indication that the
    storage subsystem is overloaded.

vmstat <interval in seconds> <number of intervals>
vmstat 2 10

vmstat -S m (vmstat -Size megabytes) requires k, K, m or M (default is kb

Table 8-2.  Column Descriptions of vmstat Output
Column Description
R	Number of processes waiting for runtime
b 	Number of processes in uninterruptible sleep
swpd 	Total virtual memory (swap) in use (KB)
free 	Total idle memory (KB)
buff	Total memory used as buffers (KB)
cache 	Total memory used as cache (KB)
si 	Memory swapped in from disk (KB/s)
so 	Memory swapped out to disk (KB/s)
bi 	Blocks read in (blocks/s) from block device
bo 	Blocks written out (blocks/s) per second to block device
in 	Interrupts per second
cs 	Context switches per second
us 	User-level code time as a percentage of total CPU time
sy 	System-level code time as a percentage of total CPU time
id 	Idle time as a percentage of total CPU time
wa 	Time waiting for I/O completion
st 	Time stolen from virtual machine


another way to see process running, is with the watch tool, this command is used to execute another program on a period basis

eg:

watch -n 5 -d vmstat

this command executes the program vmstat every 5 seconds and highlight the changes on screen
